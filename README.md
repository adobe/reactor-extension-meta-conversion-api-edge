The Conversions API allows advertisers to send web events from their servers directly to Meta. Server events are linked to a pixel and are processed like browser pixel events. This means that server events are used in measurement, reporting, and optimization in the same way as browser pixel events.

This repository contains the extension/plug-in that advertisers can install on their property and send signals to Meta's Conversions API.
