          approximately the same time (within 5 minutes of each other), the
          browser or app event is favoured.

          parameters are used to deduplicate events sent by web (via the Meta
          Pixel), app (via SDK or App Events API) or server events sent to the
          Conversions API. Note that while{' '}
          <strong>

          </strong>{' '}
          is marked optional, it is recommended for event deduplication.

        <p>
          For deduplication, the{' '}
          <strong>
            <code>eventID</code>
          </strong>{' '}
          from a browser or app event must match the{' '}
          <strong>
            <code>event_id</code>
          </strong>{' '}
          in the corresponding server event.
        </p>

        <p>
          An order number or transaction ID are two potential identifiers that
          can be used for{' '}
          <strong>
            <code>event_id</code>
          </strong>
          . For example, if a customer makes two purchases on your website with
          order numbers 123 and 456, each Conversions API call would need to
          include its respective order number for{' '}
          <strong>
            <code>event_id</code>
          </strong>
          . This allows us to properly distinguish these two purchase events as
          distinct orders. The two corresponding browser Pixel purchase events
          would need to also send the same order numbers in the{' '}
          <strong>
            <code>eventID</code>
          </strong>{' '}
          parameter for us to understand that there were only two events that
          took place, not four unique purchases.
        </p>

        <p>
          For other events without an intrinsic ID number, a random number (so
          long as the same random number is sent between browser and server
          events) can be used.
